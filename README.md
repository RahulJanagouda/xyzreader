# xyzreader
---------------
This is the XYZ Reader(P5) project under Udacity Android Nanodegree Program


## Project Overview
---------------
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.


## Getting Started
---------------
This sample uses the Gradle build system.  To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.


## Why this Project?
-----------------
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.


## What Will I Learn?
--------------------
Through this project, student will:
* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.


## User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
-----------------------------------
* This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.
* Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision.
* The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.


## Rubric
----------
### Required Behavior
* App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
* App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
* App theme extends from AppCompat.
* App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
* App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
* App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
* App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
* App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
* App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
* App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.
